# CullaX
Culla will generate a Plasma theme and window decoration colored to match your current wallpaper. Culla requires Python 3.6, **Python Pillow** and **Python ColorThief**.

Installation should be simple. In a terminal run:
```
./dumb_installer.sh
```
This will copy a Plasma and Aurorae theme, a colour scheme and a menu entry which will appear under Settings. Culla will also set the highlight and focus colour in applications but does not overwrite any saved scheme.

### Installation Issues
Depending on your distro you may need to add ~/.local/bin to your PATH.
